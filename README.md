## Parties
Not sure what order to do these without being biased. So for now it's being done by the number of seats at the moment, including defections. For the sake of inpartiality and openess, the choices of party will be 

(England)
- Conservative
- Labour 
- Liberal Democrat
- Independent
- Green
- Other (you can choose a name and colour, maybe even a logo?)

(Additional)
- ChangeUK
- Brexit
- UKIP

(Scotland)
- addition of SNP

(Wales)
- addition of Plaid Cymru

(NI)
- DUP 
- Sinn Fein
- SDLP
- UUP
- Independent
- Other

If there is a party that you want to add for your made up election, you can make a fork.
