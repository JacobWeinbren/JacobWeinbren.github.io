# Path-to-326
Path to 326...give or take depending on Sinn Fein seats, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker

A project by Dan Waterfield and Jacob W

## Parties
For the sake of inpartiality and openess, the choices of party will be 
(England)
- Labour 
- Conservative
- Liberal Democrat
- Green
- Independent
- Other (you can choose a name and colour, maybe even a logo?)
(Scotland)
- + SNP
(NI)
- DUP 
- Sinn Fein
- SDLP
- UUP
- Independent
- Other

If there is a party that you want to add for your made up election, you can make a fork.
